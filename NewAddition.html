            What Causes voter apathy? (click headers to open/close text)
        </div>
        <div id="accordion">
            <h3>Political Powerlesssness</h3>
            <div>People believe that they have no power in the government. They believe whatever their vote was gonna do, probably doesn't exsist anymore due to having no understanding of the government in the first place. They don't understand the governments connection to their lives or any other.</div>
            <h3>Political Meaninglessness</h3>
            <div>The people believe even if their vote counted, it wouldn't change what their life is like. They think that if the government does anything, it won't change anything for them</div>
            <h3>Political Normalessness</h3>
            <div>People don't understand the norm's in government, and whether they ever did was  questionable. This links really well to the meaninglessness everything the government does just seeems to be bonkers if anyone else were to do it but government? Completely normal, infact it would be suspicious if they didn't do something strange for a day. </div>
            <h3>Modern Isolation</h3>
            <div>The people of the USA have been trying to isolate themselves for years. It is what america started as and it is what is gonna drive us into the ground if we don't start connecting with people again. There is a big problem with many people that is considered the (Insert Gender) lonelyness epidemic, in which it is very common for people to just have no one to talk to. And, political parties aren't trying to talk to them kindly: The left telling men they deserve nothing but to rot and the right nothing at all. And for women it isn't much better with the left saying you don't need anyone and the right saying nothing at all. Overall the isolation of people and inability of people to make new friends or talk without getting hurt is gonna drive people away from voting and many other things.</div>
            <h3>The Political Conclusion</h3>
            <div>So, why is this also so depressing? </div>
