			<h2 class= "container-md">The backstory on why I like Programming</h2>
			<p class= "container-md">
				The main reason I got into coding was from my dad showing me linux a long time ago, and after that
				I became really intreasted in all things computer and when I was watching random programmers on youtube
				and heard them talk about how AI and game design was all in there I had decided the computer programming
				was what I had wanted to do, I just had to find a way to do it. I had tried books and online classes and 
				even some unspecific networking classes none of that worked for me, I wanted to do <strong> <em> programming
				</em></strong>. The only class I had tickled this bone was a robotics class I did in bryan, it was fun but
				the teacher wasn't that great at keeping people on track.
			</p>
			<h2 class= "container-md">Twitch streaming</h2>
			<p class= "container-md">
				I also stream on twitch 4 days a week, 8-10pm on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday as well as 7-10 on wednesday.
				I reached affiliate sometime in December. although recently it has been
				a trickle downward in average viewership, I still fully believe that I can become a great streamer.
				My twitch User name is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bugcreper">Bugcreper</a> I know no one that views this will go 
				there but, I figure it is nice info.
